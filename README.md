The Immortal Dance
The Immortal Dance is a 2d sidescrolling cyberpunk fighting game. You are a duelist who has lost their partner, and must now seek the power of the four great wells that allowed humanity to florish in order to revive her. However, you are faced with countless hoards of enemies who seek to prevent you from gaining the power of the wells, which are heavily moderated by the elites of society.

So far, the game is in a demo state, with basic movement and combat. All sprites are placeholders until I can find someone to do spritework for me.
